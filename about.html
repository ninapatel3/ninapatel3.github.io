            <h2>Why I love to read and my favorite books</h2>
            <p>I love to read because it truly captivates me like nothing else. When I read a book, time somehow finds a way to both fly and be finite—it can carry 
                on endlessly or stand motionlessly still. I first fell in love with reading years ago, when I still had a bedtime. As a young child, my most devious 
                display of delinquency occurred at night. “Nina!” my mother would shout, catching me in bed with my nose in a book. “Put the book down and go to 
                sleep!” I never wanted to put the book down; I loved getting lost in fantastical realms as the genre of fantasy was introduced to me. Whether I was 
                competing in a Quidditch game, soaring through the air on the back of a broomstick with Harry Potter, or comforting Beezus after her fights with 
                Ramona, I would lose all sense of time and space, transported into a literary nirvana. I could easily spend entire nights traveling through a wrinkled 
                portal from galaxy to galaxy with Meg in search of her father. Now that I am older and can comfortably read at all hours without a parental 
                “lights out!” mandate, I still find myself awed by literature. Through books, I can consult with Elizabeth Bennet on her feelings for Mr. Darcy or 
                travel back in time to sit with Kya Clark in the marshes of coastal North Carolina, eagerly awaiting Tate Walker. Overall, what I love so ardently 
                about reading is that it completely transforms me. Literature takes over my senses and erases the strictures of time. The feeling of being consumed by 
                a novel is like no other; it frees me to explore hundreds of worlds and stories.</p>
