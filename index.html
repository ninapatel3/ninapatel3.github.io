            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Nina Patel, and I am currently a third-year student at Northeastern University. I am pursuing a major in Data Science 
                and Economics with a minor in International Affairs. Academically, I am passionate about leveraging data to solve significant global challenges, 
                with a particular focus on the issue of climate change. This interest has driven my academic and professional pursuits, leading me to a previous 
                internship position as an Energy Markets and Sustainability Analyst at Veolia North America. In this role, I was able to apply my data science skills
                directly to energy data, assisting our clients—who were primarily large corporations looking to procure energy sustainably—in making well-informed, 
                customized energy-related decisions. This internship not only allowed me to apply several of my main academic passions but also helped lay the 
                foundational experiences that have shaped my career aspirations for after graduation. Outside the classroom, I engage in a variety of hobbies. 
                I have a passion for cooking, particularly baking. I enjoy the creative process of making birthday cakes for my friends and whipping up sweet treats 
                for enjoyment throughout the week. As for fitness, I regularly participate in running, swimming, and Pilates, and I am always open to exploring new 
                types of workouts to switch up my routine. Above all, my favorite hobby is reading. On the next page, I'll share more insights into why reading holds 
                such a special place in my heart.</p>
